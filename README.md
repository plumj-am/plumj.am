# plumj.am

A personal website written with [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/).

The website is split into 2 distinct sections:

**[plumj.am](https://plumj.am)**

The normal version of the site that displays well on all devices.

I recommend visiting this one.

**[nerd.plumj.am](https://nerd.plumj.am)**

The NeoVim inspired version of the site that is best viewed on desktop.

It does not work well on smaller screens.
