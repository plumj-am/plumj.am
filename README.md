# plumj.am

A personal website written with [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/).

[plumj.am](https://plumj.am) is the normal version of the site that displays
well on all devices. I recommend visiting this one.

[nerd.plumj.am](https://nerd.plumj.am) contains a NeoVim inspired version of the
site that is best viewed on desktop. It does not work well on smaller screens.

Both sites share the same data and mostly contain the same information.

Open an issue if you face any problems.
