# Hello World

This is my first blog post to test markdown rendering.

Here is some code:

```rust | main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Wow, it's working!?");
}
```

## Subheading 2

I don't really have a plan for this blog. I'll just write whatever comes to mind.

Probably anything about editors, languages, etc.

If that sounds interesting somehow, I hope you'll enjoy future posts :]
