# Project State

## Current Task
Creating a projects.rs component for the normal/ version of the website that displays ALL projects in a grid layout.

## Analysis Completed
- Examined normal/home.rs to understand current project display style
- Found that projects are currently displayed with:
  - Border styling: `border border-fg p-4`
  - Hover effects: `hover:bg-[var(--color-purple-light)] transition-scale hover:scale-110 duration-100`
  - Project info includes: name, type, short description, tech used, and links (GitHub/site)
  - Currently shows only 6 projects with `.take(6)`

## Data Structure
- Projects imported from `common::data::PROJECTS`
- Each project has: name, project_type, short_desc, tech_used_str(), github_url(), site_url

## Completed Tasks
- Examined common/data.rs - found PROJECTS array with 15 total projects
- Created normal/projects.rs with:
  - Grid layout: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
  - Displays ALL projects (no .take(6) limitation)
  - Same styling as home.rs Projects component
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Shows project count in header: "All Projects ({PROJECTS.len()})"

## Component Features
- Uses same project card styling from home.rs
- Same hover effects and transitions
- Shows all project information: name, type, description, tech stack, and links
- Responsive grid that adapts from 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop

## Integration Completed
- Added `mod projects;` to normal/main.rs:5
- Added `use projects::Projects as ProjectsPage;` to imports in normal/main.rs:10
- Updated the placeholder Projects route component to use `ProjectsPage {}`
- Verified compilation with `cargo check` - all tests pass
- Component is now accessible at `/projects` route
